Examples:

Run `puts Rails.env` after loading the app:

  bin/rails runner 'puts Rails.env'

Run the Ruby file located at `path/to/filename.rb` after loading the app:

  bin/rails runner path/to/filename.rb

<% if RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os'] !~ /mswin|mingw/ %>
You can also use the runner command as a shebang line for your executables:

  #!/usr/bin/env <%= File.expand_path(command) %>

  Product.all.each { |p| p.price *= 2 ; p.save! }
<% end %>
